[x] Add time to clock when setting to compensate for upload time
[x] Integrate a pushbutton for DST adjustment
[x] Ordered a new DS3231 (upgrade from DS1307), which has an internal oscillator from Adafruit for testing
[x] Possible code execution affecting clock reads (serial process?) - NOT THE CASE
[x] Check voltage draw from battery on whole board - NONE
[x] PySerial script to record system time and Teensy output - NOT THE ISSUE
[x] Drift could be caused by the battery power vs the VCC power - NOT THE CASE
[x] Recording battery serial output will require a USB cable without power from the computer to the Teensy (probably still need to power Teensy board with USB though)
[x] Consider connecting LED screen to display time for now - NOT ENOUGH PINS
